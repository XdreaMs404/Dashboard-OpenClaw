# Reopen S012 to canonical scope (2026-02-22)

## Reason
`STORIES_INDEX` mapped `S012` to canonical `E01-S12` (Journal décisionnel de gouvernance phase/gate),
but active `S012.md` + completion artifacts were still on metadata-validator scope (E02), causing a critical epic/story mismatch.

## Action
- Archived legacy S012 story/review/summary/ux/handoffs from active folders.
- Recreated active `stories/S012.md` with canonical `E01-S12` scaffold.
- `S012` is now expected to be re-implemented/revalidated on the correct canonical scope.

## Source of truth
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`
